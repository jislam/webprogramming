				Yesterday I went to the store and got some much-needed spatulas! (What better way to say I love myself than to buy myself a spatula?)

				My favorite cartoon character is Cookie Monster, and my favorite dessert is cupcakes, so Cookie Monster cupcakes are the best of both worlds.
			</p>
			<p>
				 Did you know? Cookie Monster once said, 
				 <q>Sometimes me think what is love, and then me think love is what last cookie is for. Me give up the last cookie for you.</q> 
				 I wonder if the same applies for cupcakes? (If so, I don't think I can ever love ANYONE!)
